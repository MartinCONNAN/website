         <h2>My experience in Brazil</h2>
         <p>
     	   In 2014, I moved to Brazil with my two parents and two younger brothers. We went to Sao Paulo and I studied at the French high school Pasteur where I spent most of my schooling from my 5th grade to my 10th grade. It was there that I visited the most beautiful countries in South America such as Peru and Bolivia.

         <h3>My life at ESSEC</h3>
         <p>
         At ESSEC since September 2022, I really blossomed in this school where I met incredible people and the atmosphere is worthy of the American schools in the movies. Moreover, the courses are very interesting and allow to better understand the life which surrounds us.

         <h4>My family</h4>
         <p>In my family, there are my two parents who are both 47 years old, there are also my two little brothers with whom I have a very good relationship. One is 11 years old and the other is 15. I am very close to my 21 year old cousin who is also in business school at EDHEC. Besides, we both go on vacation in May. All this to say that I have a very good relationship with my family which is a strength.
